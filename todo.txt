Relay server tools improvement ideas
======================================

- list the checkpoint times in specmode (maybe only on relayTVs)
- add a live ranking of the actual round and overall score (maybe only on relayTVs)


- It would be really cool to filter the chat. So for example, if there are 3-4 relays (e.g. FET-Final relay A-D) 
that you can switch between the chat of the different servers. 
e.g. I'm on relay A, but wanne see, what's written on the other servers. Then we can have different chat streams (matchserver,relay A,B,C and D). 
So i can switch between the serverschatstreams and read (all) and write to them (only relay chatstream). 
Also a longer chatbox would be great, where you can scroll a little bit (more than just pressing c in TMF).
